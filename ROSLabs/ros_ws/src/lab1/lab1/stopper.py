		# Every time we get a laser scan, calculate the shortest scan distance in front
		# of the robot, and set the speed accordingly.  We assume that the robot is 38cm
		# wide.  This means that y-values with absolute values greater than 19cm are not
		# in front of the robot.  It also assumes that the LiDAR is at the front of the
		# robot (which it actually isn't) and that it's centered and pointing forwards.
		# We can work around these assumptions, but it's cleaner if we don't

		# Pulling out some useful values from scan
		#   Start and top angles of the scan. 0 degrees is in front of the robot
		# Also given: Total number of scans in that range
		angle_min = scan.angle_min

		# GUIDE
		# Use angle min, max, and number of readings to calculate the theta value for each scan
		# This should be a numpy array of length num_readings, that starts at angle_min and ends at angle_max
  # YOUR CODE HERE

		# GUIDE: Determine what the closest obstacle/reading is for scans in front of the robot
		#  Step 1: Determine which of the range readings correspond to being "in front of" the robot (see comment at top)
		#    Remember that robot scans are in the robot's coordinate system - theta = 0 means straight ahead
		#  Step 2: Get the minimum distance to the closest object (use only scans "in front of" the robot)
		#  Step 3: Use the closest distance from above to decide when to stop
		#  Step 4: Scale how fast you move by the distance to the closet object (tanh is handy here...)
		#  Step 5: Make sure to actually stop if close to 1 m
		# Finally, set t.linear.x to be your desired speed (0 if stop)
		# Suggestion: Do this with a for loop before being fancy with numpy (which is substantially faster)
		# DO NOT hard-wire in the number of readings, or the min/max angle. You CAN hardwire in the size of the robot

		# Create a twist and fill in all the fields (you will only set t.linear.x).
